To activate safe mode, add the following line to your wp-config.php file, somewhere before the line that reads “/* That’s all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */“:

define('CODE_SNIPPETS_SAFE_MODE', true);

After enabling safe mode, you should be able to log in to your WordPress dashboard and deactivate or fix the snippet that was causing the issue.

Once this is done, you can to turn safe mode off by either commenting out this line or deleting it.

A more convenient way to enable sage mode on a per-page basis is by appending ?snippets-safe-mode=true to the URL of the current page.
